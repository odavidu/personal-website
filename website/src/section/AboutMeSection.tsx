            <p>
                I'm a junior at Boston University and I am currently pursing a Bachelor of Arts in <u>Mathematics and
                Computer Science</u>. I'm especially fascinated by quantum computing, which combines
                abstract mathematics, computer science, and physics to solve problems that classical computers canâ€™t.
                I'm also curious about how these ideas can evolve into future technologies and applications.
                Outside of academics, I enjoy playing tennis and staying active.
